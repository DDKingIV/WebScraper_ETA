# WebScraper_ETA

This python script takes an excel file with a list of all shipment for which we want to know the estimated time of arrival from the shipping lines websites.
Then it repeatedly scrapes the web to get the date from the shipping line.
It then outputs a file containe the date for each shipment

YOU NEED A CHROMEDRIVER TO RUN THIS AND YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE LOCATION OF IT IN THE "Variables.py" File
